        <p class="lead mb-4">Some fun facts about me: I have a German Shepherd; I am Diamond 1 in League of Legends;I am a certified Level 10 CM for Piano. I'm an aspiring veterinarian who is currently studying Biology in University of California: Riverside. Right now, I am part of Dr. Kurt Anderson's Ecology Lab investigating protist ecology. At the research lab, I am responsible for sampling different cultures containing different protist species that act as either predators or prey. Some of the common protists that we actively investigate are Euploides (which are a predator species) and Tetras (which are prey species). Ecological relationships in protists greatly reflect dynamic relationships in the real world, and thus studies using protists are great reflections about our own ecological system. Population growth, relationships, and success are all vital parts in this lab. I am a sophomore as of 2020, and will be a junior this coming September. I'm currently taking all the prerequisites for upper division biology. Some of the classes I'm currently fulfilling are Organic Chemistry, Physics, and Breadth Requirements. Past classes I have taken are: General Chemistry Series, Calculus A and Calculus B, English Series, Biology Series, Archaeology, and all the accompanying labs associated with General Chemistry and Biology. <br><br>

        I have had a lot of experience with interpersonal activities. I've was a junior golf coach for about 2 years and have had the opportunity to take multiple students onto the course to practice. I was a Varsity Team Captain for my high school golf team, so I was ready to help out at Black Gold. Besides golf, I was also actively involved in a lot of volunteer opportunities around my community. I was a volunteer for a program called Mighty Tykes, responsible for promoting the importance of sports to young kids. During my time volunteering there, we introduced many sports to the kids, such as: soccer, basketball, tennis, track and field, and plenty more. Aside from recreational volunteers, I was also an office aid for the Fullerton Chinese School, which was on Sunny Hills High School property. I was responsible for daily announcements, printing homework for all the classes, and distributing event forms out to all the students and parents. <br><br>

        I had a summer long internship at Bisous Animal Hospital, which is located in Zhongli, Taiwan. I spent the whole summer living independently in Taiwan, and had the opportunity to experience the cultural varieties outside of the United States. During my internship, I had the opportunity to practice many veterinarian techniques. Some of the techniques I practiced were: blood draws, blood analysis, bandaging, cast wrapping, microscopic analysis of cell count, surgical assist, production of pharmaceutical drugs for the animals, and overall patient and customer communication.
